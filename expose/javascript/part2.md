    A. student.name
    B. student['Grad Year']
    C. student.greeting()
    D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. 
    A. '32' is returned since integers map to their exact string representation.
    B. 1 is returned since 3 is converted into a number before subtraction.
    C. 3 is returned since null is converted into 0.
    D. '3null' is returned since integers map to their exact string representation and the string 'null' is concatenated.
    E. 4 is returned since true is mapped to the integer 1.
    F. 0 is returned since false and null are both converted into 0.
    G. '3undefined' is returned since integers map to their exact string representation and the string 'undefined' is concatenated.
    H. NaN is returned since the conversion failed as undefined does not have a valid number associated with it.
14. 
    A. True is returned since the string '2' becomes a number 2.
    B. False is returned since the first character of '12' is less than 2.
    C. True is returned since '2' becomes a number 2.
    D. False is returned since the number 2 does not equal the string '2'.
    E. False is returned since 'true' is type converted into the number 1, which does not equal the number 2.
    F. True is returned since in Javascript, any non-zero number is considered to be a truth value, and the booleans are equal.
15. The difference between the '==' operator and the '===' operator is that the triple equal sign operator checks 
    the equality of two elements without the type conversion that the '==' uses.
16. Code in part2-question16.js.
17. The result of running the function above with the specified parameters results in a array returned with the values: "[ 2, 4, 6 ]".
    I arrived at this result because the doSomething array multiplies a value by 2, and modify array simply iterates through the entire array, and calling the doSomething on every value.
